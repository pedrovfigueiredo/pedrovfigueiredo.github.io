Estimates surfaces of arbitrary watertight triangle meshes by approximating signed distance functions (SDFs). We use an efficient octree to approximate distance values of nearby triangles. Allows real-time visualization of operations best defined in the implicit SDF representation such as the offset, union, and intersection.
