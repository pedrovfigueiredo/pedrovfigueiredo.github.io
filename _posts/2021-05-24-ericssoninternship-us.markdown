<!-- Designed hardware resource forecaster for network infrastructure. Containerized solution uses statistical and deep-learning methods trained on existing logged usage data. Allows on-demand probability forecast suiting diverse use-cases. Lead the development of smart search engine for network defects. Containerized API and interface allows engineers to quickly find previously logged solutions of similar defects across Ericsson global. Uses combination of existing search algorithms and trained NLP models for enhanced suggestions. Validated and approved by network engineers. -->

Developed a containerized hardware resource forecaster using statistical and deep-learning models on logged usage data to deliver on-demand probability forecasts. Also led the creation of a smart search engine for network defects at Ericssonâ€”combining search algorithms with NLP models in a containerized API and interface that lets engineers quickly find similar logged solutions.
